# Happy-birthday
Internship homework for gotoAndPlay.

Website concept is to wish happy birthday to gotoAndPlay.
  In the background there are constant fireworks showing up and exploding, some one-colored, others multi-colored. Visitor can also create new firework explosion by left clicking anywhere on the site. The fireworks will be removed from the site after they've gone transparent in order not to create performance issues. The fireworks are set up with p5.js, which helps to create, control and modify each particle.
  In the middle of the screen, there's the companys' logo and by hovering over it, a happy birthday wish shows up and the logo changes color.
  The whole creation progress was really exciting for me, because altering the small details had big impacts on the outcome and seeing it all come together was really fulfilling.
  All in all, it took me around 11 hours to create this project and around a quarter of the time went to learn about p5.js, because it was my first time to work with a particle system.
